    /// anywhere within the system by pressing `` Cmd+` ``:

    ///     restored when the application is restarted on systems that support
    ///     window restoration like macOS.

    ///     X11, and only on Wayland compositors that support the `wlr-layer-shell-v1`
    ///     protocol. In practice, this means that only GNOME users would not be
