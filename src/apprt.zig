//! "apprt" is the "application runtime" package. This abstracts the
//! application runtime and lifecycle management such as creating windows,
//! getting user input (mouse/keyboard), etc.
//!
//! This enables compile-time interfaces to be built to swap out the underlying
//! application runtime. For example: pure macOS Cocoa, GTK+, browser, etc.
//!
//! The goal is to have different implementations share as much of the core
//! logic as possible, and to only reach out to platform-specific implementation
//! code when absolutely necessary.
